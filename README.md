# Get Started

## An open API from the University of Maryland
This is an API for accessing the daily COVID-19 World Symptoms Survey data. 
The details of our methodology, disclaimer, and release log can be checked [here](https://covidmap.umd.edu/methodology.html).

Data calculated based on the Facebook global symptoms survey data. Using the survey data, we estimate the percentage of people in a given country or region.

**The base path.** All URLs referenced in the documentation have the base path `https://covidmap.umd.edu/api/`

**The endpoint path.** For example, `resources?indicator={indicator}&type={type}&country={country}&date={date}`

**Required parameters.** These parameters must be included in a request. In the example above, `{indicator}`, `{type}`, `{country}`, and `{date}` are required. In a request, you will replace the placeholders with real values.

**Optional parameters.** These additional parameters can be included to customize a query to get regional aggregates, smoothed aggregates, all regions, etc.

### Example
`https://covidmap.umd.edu/api/resources?indicator=covid&type=smoothed&country=italy&date=20201110`

```
{"data": 
  [
      {
          "smoothed_cli": 0.008213,
          "smoothed_cli_se": 0.000709,
          "sample_size": 30879.0,
          "country": "Italy",
          "iso_code": "ITA",
          "gid_0": "ITA",
          "survey_date": "20201110"
      }
    ],
          "status": "success"
