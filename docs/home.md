# COVID-19 World Survey Open Data API
An Open API to access aggregated COVID-19 World Survey data.

# About

The COVID-19 World Symptoms Survey is a partnership between Facebook and other academic institutions. The survey is available in 56 languages. A representative sample of Facebook users is invited on a daily basis to report on symptoms, social distancing behavior, mental health issues, and financial constraints. 

Facebook provides weights to reduce nonresponse and coverage bias. Country and region-level statistics are published daily via public API and dashboards, and microdata are available for researchers via data use agreements.  

Over half a million responses are collected daily.  Data for the United States is not included in the World Symptoms Survey but is available at [covidcast.cmu.edu](https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/?date=20210308&region=42003)
